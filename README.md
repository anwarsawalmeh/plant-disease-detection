# Plant Disease Detection using CNNs and Perceptron-Based Hybrid Ensemble

This project presents a deep learning-based system for classifying plant leaf diseases using multiple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures and a novel hybrid ensemble model. The goal is to provide an effective, scalable, and highly accurate method for early disease detection, particularly valuable in low-resource and rural agricultural settings.
